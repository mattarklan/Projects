  <h2>Core Mechatronics Projects</h2>

  <h3>ROS2 Autonomous Robot</h3>
  <p>
    Took a differential drive robot and made it fully autonomous using a Raspberry Pi 5 and ROS2.
    Set up sensors, navigation, and control so it could operate without manual input.
  </p>

  <h3>Warman 2023 Competition (Winning Team)</h3>
  <p>
    Led programming and electrical design in a three-person team that won Warman 2023.
    Built and integrated control systems under competition constraints.
  </p>

  <h3>Sony Camera PCB Reverse Engineering</h3>
  <p>
    Recreated an obsolete Sony camera PCB by building a full schematic and new layout.
    Board was manufactured and worked as intended.
  </p>

  <h3>3 kW TPFC + PSFB EV Charger (Design Stage)</h3>
  <p>
    Designed a 3 kW two-phase PFC and phase-shifted full-bridge charger in KiCad.
    Completed schematic and PCB layout; hardware not yet built.
  </p>

  <h3>ESP32 3-Phase Water Heater Power Control</h3>
  <p>
    Used an ESP32 and 3-phase solid state relay to PWM a 13 kW resistive load.
    Added Wi-Fi interface for adjustable power control.
  </p>

  <h3>Electric Vehicle Conversion</h3>
  <p>
    Converted a petrol vehicle to fully electric.
    Mounted batteries, completed high-voltage wiring, and integrated systems.
  </p>

  <h3>Autonomous Tracked Lawnmower (Prototype)</h3>
  <p>
    Developing a tracked autonomous mower platform.
    One drive side complete; planned LoRa and RTK integration for navigation.
